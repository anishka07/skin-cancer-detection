# Skin Cancer Detection using VGG-16 deep learning model.

This projects aims to detect skin cancer in patients based on image and it classifies weather the patient has cancer or not. That is, it calssifies weather the cancer is malignant (bad) or bening (good).

This project is completed with the help of transfer learning, a branch of deep learning and the famous, pre-trained VGG-16 deep learning model. 


## Run

To run this project, create a conda environment or a virtual environment in your project directory with the following command:

```bash
  conda create -n "virutal env name"
```
If you're using virutal env, run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv "virtual env name"
source "virtual env name"/bin/activate
```
After the creation of the virutal environment, you can run the following command to install all the project dependencies:
